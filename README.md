# GitHub Repo Finder 🔍

Using the GitHub API, this app allows you to search for a repo depending on a search term. This is one of my React challenges 💪🏼, through this project I wanted to learn React Router Dom, asynchronous functions with Axios and Material UI.

## Features
1. Search a repo using a key word (longer than three letters)
2. On Keydown "Enter" the search is triggered
3. If you're interested by one repo, you can access more information by clicking on the repo card
4. The message toast below the search bar will inform you the number of results found, but only the first 30 repos are displayed (I will add a pagination feature later on allowing you to see more results 😉)
5. F.A.Q explaining the app
